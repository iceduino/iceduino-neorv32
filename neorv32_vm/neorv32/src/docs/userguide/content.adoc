Let's Get It Started!

To make your NEORV32 project run, follow the guides from the upcoming sections. Follow these guides
step by step and in the presented order.

:sectnums:
== Software Toolchain Setup

To compile (and debug) executables for the NEORV32 a RISC-V toolchain is required.
There are two possibilities to get this:

1. Download and _build_ the official RISC-V GNU toolchain yourself
2. Download and install a prebuilt version of the toolchain; this might also done via the package manager / app store of your OS

[TIP]
The default toolchain prefix for this project is **`riscv32-unknown-elf-`**. Of course you can use any other RISC-V
toolchain (like `riscv64-unknown-elf-`) that is capable to emit code for a `rv32` architecture. Just change the _RISCV_PREFIX_ variable in the application
makefile(s) according to your needs or define this variable when invoking the makefile.

[IMPORTANT]
Keep in mind that – for instance – a rv32imc toolchain only provides library code compiled with
compressed (_C_) and `mul`/`div` instructions (_M_)! Hence, this code cannot be executed (without
emulation) on an architecture without these extensions!


:sectnums:
=== Building the Toolchain from Scratch

To build the toolchain by yourself you can follow the guide from the official https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain GitHub page.
You need to make sure the generated toolchain fits the architecture of the NEORV32 core. To get a toolchain that even supports minimal
ISA extension configurations, it is recommend to compile for `rv32i` only. Please note that this minimal ISA also provides further ISA
extensions like `m` or `c`. Of course you can use a `multilib` approach to generate
toolchains for several target ISAs.

.Configuring GCC build for `rv32i` (minimal ISA)
[source,bash]
----
riscv-gnu-toolchain$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv --with-arch=rv32i –-with-abi=ilp32
riscv-gnu-toolchain$ make
----


:sectnums:
=== Downloading and Installing a Prebuilt Toolchain

Alternatively, you can download a prebuilt toolchain.

:sectnums:
==== Use The Toolchain I have Build

I have compiled a GCC toolchain on a 64-bit x86 Ubuntu (Ubuntu on Windows, actually) and uploaded it to
GitHub. You can directly download the according toolchain archive as single _zip-file_ within a packed
release from https://github.com/stnolting/riscv-gcc-prebuilt.

Unpack the downloaded toolchain archive and copy the content to a location in your file system (e.g.
`/opt/riscv`). More information about downloading and installing my prebuilt toolchains can be found in
the repository's README.


:sectnums:
==== Use a Third Party Toolchain

Of course you can also use any other prebuilt version of the toolchain. There are a lot  RISC-V GCC packages out there -
even for Windows. On Linux system you might even be able to fetch a toolchain via your distribution's package manager.

[IMPORTANT]
Make sure the toolchain can (also) emit code for a `rv32i` architecture, uses the `ilp32` or `ilp32e` ABI and **was not build** using
CPU extensions that are not supported by the NEORV32 (like `D`).


:sectnums:
=== Installation

Now you have the toolchain binaries. The last step is to add them to your `PATH` environment variable (if you have not
already done so): make sure to add the _binaries_ folder (`bin`) of your toolchain.

[source,bash]
----
$ export PATH:$PATH:/opt/riscv/bin
----

You should add this command to your `.bashrc` (if you are using bash) to automatically add the RISC-V
toolchain at every console start.

:sectnums:
=== Testing the Installation

To make sure everything works fine, navigate to an example project in the NEORV32 example folder and
execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
neorv32/sw/example/blink_led$ make check
----

This will test all the tools required for the generating NEORV32 executables.
Everything is working fine if `Toolchain check OK` appears at the end.

:sectnums:
== General Hardware Setup

This guide will setup a NEORV32 project for FPGA implementation (or simulation only) _from scratch_

[TIP]
If you want to use a complete pre-defined setup to start with, check out the
project's `setups` folder (https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/tree/master/setups),
which provides (script-based) demo setups for various FPGA boards and toolchains.

This tutorial uses a _simplified_ test setup of the processor
to keeps things simple at the beginning as this setup is intended as
evaluation or "hello world" project to check out the NEORV32.

[start=1]
. Create a new project with your FPGA EDA tool of choice.
. Add all VHDL files from the project's `rtl/core` folder to your project. Make sure to _reference_ the
files only – do not copy them.
. Make sure to add all the rtl files to a new library called `neorv32`. If your FPGA tools does not
provide a field to enter the library name, check out the "properties" menu of the added rtl files.
. The `rtl/core/neorv32_top.vhd` VHDL file is the top entity of the NEORV32 processor. If you
already have a design, instantiate this unit into your design and proceed.

[IMPORTANT]
Make sure to include the `neorv32` package into your design when instantiating the processor: add
`library neorv32;` and `use neorv32.neorv32_package.all;` to your design unit.

[start=5]
. If you do not have a design yet and just want to check out the NEORV32 – no problem! This guide
uses a simplified top entity, that encapsulates the actual processor top entity: add the
`rtl/templates/processor/neorv32_ProcessorTop_Test.vhd` VHDL file to your project, too, and
select it as _top entity_.
. This test setup provides a minimal test hardware setup:

.NEORV32 "hello world" test setup
image::neorv32_test_setup.png[align=center]

[start=7]
. It only implements some very basic processor and CPU features. Also, only the
minimum number of signals is propagated to the outer world.
. However, a minimal setup-specific configuration of the NEORV32 processor is required to make it run
on your FPGA board of choice. Only the absolutely required modifications will be made while
keeping the default configuration for the remaining configuration options:

.Cut-out of `neorv32_ProcessorTop_Test.vhd` showing the processor instance and its configuration
[source,vhdl]
----
neorv32_top_inst: neorv32_top

  INT_BOOTLOADER_EN => true,
  ...
  -- Internal instruction memory --

  MEM_INT_IMEM_SIZE => 16*1024, # <2>
  -- Internal data memory --
  MEM_INT_DMEM_EN   => true,
  MEM_INT_DMEM_SIZE => 8*1024, # <3>
  ...
----
<1> Clock frequency of `clk_i` signal in Hertz
<2> Default size of internal instruction memory: 16kB
<3> Default size of internal data memory: 8kB

[start=9]
. There is one generic that has to be set according to your FPGA board setup: the actual clock frequency
of the top's clock input signal (`clk_i`). Use the _CLOCK_FREQUENC_Y generic to specify your clock source's
frequency in Hertz (Hz) (note "1").
. If you feel like it – or if your FPGA does not provide many resources – you can modify the
**memory sizes** (_MEM_INT_IMEM_SIZE_ and _MEM_INT_DMEM_SIZE_ – marked with notes "2" and "3") or even
exclude certain ISA extensions and peripheral modules from implementation - but as mentioned above, let's keep things
simple at first and use the standard configuration for now.

[NOTE]
If you have changed the default memory configuration (_MEM_INT_IMEM_SIZE_ and _MEM_INT_DMEM_SIZE_ generics)
keep those new sizes in mind – these values are required for setting
up the software framework in the next section <<_general_software_framework_setup>>.

[start=11]
. Depending on your FPGA tool of choice, it is time to assign the signals of the test setup top entity to
the according pins of your FPGA board. All the signals can be found in the entity declaration:

.Entity signals of `neorv32_test_setup.vhd`
[source,vhdl]
----
entity neorv32_test_setup is
  port (
    -- Global control --
    clk_i       : in std_ulogic := '0'; -- global clock, rising edge
    rstn_i      : in std_ulogic := '0'; -- global reset, low-active, async
    -- GPIO --
    gpio_o      : out std_ulogic_vector(7 downto 0); -- parallel output
    -- UART0 --
    uart0_txd_o : out std_ulogic; -- UART0 send data
    uart0_rxd_i : in std_ulogic := '0' -- UART0 receive data
);
end neorv32_test_setup;
----

[start=12]
. Attach the clock input `clk_i` to your clock source and connect the reset line `rstn_i` to a button of
your FPGA board. Check whether it is low-active or high-active – the reset signal of the processor is
**low-active**, so maybe you need to invert the input signal.
. If possible, connected at least bit `0` of the GPIO output port `gpio_o` to a high-active LED (invert
the signal when your LEDs are low-active). This LED will be used as status LED for the setup.
. Finally, if your FPGA board provides a serial host interface (USB-to-serial converter) interface,
connect the UART communication signals `uart0_txd_o` and `uart0_rxd_i`.
. Perform the project HDL compilation (synthesis, mapping, bitstream generation).
. Program the generated bitstream into your FPGA and press the button connected to the reset signal.
. Done! The assigned status LED should be flashing now for some sections before permanently lighting up.

:sectnums:
== General Software Framework Setup

To allow executables to be _actually executed_ on the NEORV32 Processor the configuration of the software framework
has to be aware to the hardware configuration. This guide focuses on the memory configuration. To enabled
certain CPU ISA festures refer to the <<_enabling_risc_v_cpu_extensions>> section.

[TIP]
If you have **not** changed the _default_ memory configuration in section <<_general_hardware_setup>>
you are already done and you can skip the rest of this guide.

[start=1]
. Open the NEORV32 linker script `sw/common/neorv32.ld` with a text editor. Right at the
beginning of this script you will find the `MEMORY` configuration listing the different memory section:

.Cut-out of the linker script `neorv32.ld`: `ram` memory section configuration
[source,c]
----
MEMORY
{
  ram  (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x80000000, LENGTH = DEFINED(make_bootloader) ? 512 : 8*1024 # <1>
...
----
<1> Size of the data memory address space (right-most value) (internal/external DMEM); here 8kB

[start=2]
. We only need to change the `ram` section, which presents the available data address space.
If you have changed the DMEM (_MEM_INT_DMEM_SIZE_ generic) size adapt the `LENGTH` parameter of the `ram`
section (here: `8*1024`) so it is equal to your DMEM hardware configuration.

[IMPORTANT]
Make sure you only modify the _right-most_ value (here: 8*1024)! +
The "`512`" are not relevant for the application.

[start=3]
. Done! Save your changes and close the linker script.

.Advanced: Section base address and size

:sectnums:
== Application Program Compilation

This guide shows how to compile an example C-code application into a NEORV32 executable that
can be uploaded via the bootloader or the on-chip debugger.

[IMPORTANT]
If your FPGA board does not provide such an interface - don't worry!
Section <<_installing_an_executable_directly_into_memory>> shows how to
run custom programs on your FPGA setup without having a UART.

[start=1]
. Open a terminal console and navigate to one of the project's example programs. For instance, navigate to the
simple `sw/example_blink_led` example program. This program uses the NEORV32 GPIO module to display
an 8-bit counter on the lowest eight bit of the `gpio_o` output port.
. To compile the project and generate an executable simply execute:

[source,bash]
----
neorv32/sw/example/blink_led$ make clean_all exe
----

[start=3]
. We are using the `clean_all` taret to make sure everything is re-build.
. This will compile and link the application sources together with all the included libraries. At the end,
your application is transformed into an ELF file (`main.elf`). The _NEORV32 image generator_ (in `sw/image_gen`)
takes this file and creates a final executable. The makefile will show the resulting memory utilization and
the executable size:

[source,bash]
----
neorv32/sw/example/blink_led$ make clean_all exe
Memory utilization:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   3176       0     120    3296     ce0 main.elf
Compiling ../../../sw/image_gen/image_gen
Executable (neorv32_exe.bin) size in bytes:
3188
----

[start=5]
. That's it. The `exe` target has created the actual executable `neorv32_exe.bin` in the current folder
that is ready to be uploaded to the processor.

[TIP]
The compilation process will also create a `main.asm` assembly listing file in the current folder, which
shows the actual assembly code of the application.



<<<
// ####################################################################################################################
:sectnums:
== Uploading and Starting of a Binary Executable Image via UART

Follow this guide to use the bootloader to upload an executable via UART.

[NOTE]
This concept uses the default "Indirect Boot" scenario that uses the bootloader to upload new executables.
See datasheet section https://stnolting.github.io/neorv32/#_indirect_boot[Indirect Boot] for more information.

[IMPORTANT]
If your FPGA board does not provide such an interface - don't worry!
Section <<_installing_an_executable_directly_into_memory>> shows how to
run custom programs on your FPGA setup without having a UART.

[start=1]
. Connect the primary UART (UART0) interface of your FPGA board to a serial port of your host computer.
. Start a terminal program. In this tutorial, I am using TeraTerm for Windows. You can download it fore free
from https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en

[NOTE]
_Any_ terminal program that can connect to a serial port should work. However, make sure the program
can transfer data in _raw_ byte mode without any protocol overhead around it.

[start=3]
. Open a connection to the the serial port your UART is connected to. Configure the terminal setting according to the
following parameters:

* 19200 Baud
* 8 data bits
* 1 stop bit
* no parity bits
* _no_ transmission/flow control protocol
* receiver (host computer) newline on `\r\n` (carriage return & newline)

[start=4]
. Also make sure that single chars are send from your computer _without_ any consecutive "new line" or "carriage
return" commands (this is highly dependent on your terminal application of choice, TeraTerm only
sends the raw chars by default).
. Press the NEORV32 reset button to restart the bootloader. The status LED starts blinking and the
bootloader intro screen appears in your console. Hurry up and press any key (hit space!) to abort the
automatic boot sequence and to start the actual bootloader user interface console.

.Bootloader console; aborted auto-boot sequence

Aborted.

Available commands:
h: Help
r: Restart
u: Upload
s: Store to flash
l: Load from flash
e: Execute

----

[start=6]
. Execute the "Upload" command by typing `u`. Now the bootloader is waiting for a binary executable to be send.

[source,bash]
----
CMD:> u
Awaiting neorv32_exe.bin...
----

[start=7]
. Use the "send file" option of your terminal program to send a NEORV32 executable (`neorv32_exe.bin`).
. Again, make sure to transmit the executable in raw binary mode (no transfer protocol).
When using TeraTerm, select the "binary" option in the send file dialog.
. If everything went fine, OK will appear in your terminal:

[source,bash]
----
CMD:> u
Awaiting neorv32_exe.bin... OK
----

[start=10]
. The executable is now in the instruction memory of the processor. To execute the program right
now run the "Execute" command by typing `e`:

[source,bash]
----
CMD:> u
Awaiting neorv32_exe.bin... OK
CMD:> e
Booting...
Blinking LED demo program
----

[start=11]
. If everything went fine, you should see the LEDs blinking.

[NOTE]
The bootloader will print error codes if something went wrong.
See section https://stnolting.github.io/neorv32/#_bootloader[Bootloader] of the NEORV32 datasheet for more information.

[TIP]
See section <<_programming_an_external_spi_flash_via_the_bootloader>> to learn how to use an external SPI
flash for nonvolatile program storage.

[TIP]
Executables can also be uploaded via the **on-chip debugger**.
See section <<_debugging_with_gdb>> for more information.

// ####################################################################################################################
:sectnums:
== Installing an Executable Directly Into Memory

If you do not want to use the bootloader (or the on-chip debugger) for executable upload or if your setup does not provide
a serial interface for that, you can also directly install an application into embedded memory.

This concept uses the "Direct Boot" scenario that implements the processor-internal IMEM as ROM, which is
pre-initialized with the application's executable during synthesis. Hence, it provides _non-volatile_ storage of the
executable inside the processor. This storage cannot be altered during runtime and any source code modification of
the application requires to re-program the FPGA via the bitstream.

[TIP]
See datasheet section https://stnolting.github.io/neorv32/#_direct_boot[Direct Boot] for more information.



Using the IMEM as ROM:

* for this boot concept the bootloader is no longer required
* this concept only works for the internal IMEM (but can be extended to work with external memories coupled via the processor's bus interface)
* make sure that the memory components (like block RAM) the IMEM is mapped to support an initialization via the bitstream

[start=1]
. At first, make sure your processor setup actually implements the internal IMEM: the `MEM_INT_IMEM_EN` generics has to be set to `true`:

.Processor top entity configuration - enable internal IMEM
[source,vhdl]
----
  -- Internal Instruction memory --
  MEM_INT_IMEM_EN => true, -- implement processor-internal instruction memory
----

[start=2]
. For this setup we do not want the bootloader to be implemented at all. Disable implementation of the bootloader by setting the
`INT_BOOTLOADER_EN` generic to `false`. This will also modify the processor-internal IMEM so it is initialized with the executable during synthesis.

.Processor top entity configuration - disable internal bootloader
[source,vhdl]
----
  -- General --
  INT_BOOTLOADER_EN => false, -- boot configuration: false = boot from int/ext (I)MEM
----

[start=3]
. To generate an "initialization image" for the IMEM that contains the actual application, run the `install` target when compiling your application:

[source,bash]
----
neorv32/sw/example/blink_led$ make clean_all install
Memory utilization:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   3176       0     120    3296     ce0 main.elf
Compiling ../../../sw/image_gen/image_gen
Installing application image to ../../../rtl/core/neorv32_application_image.vhd
----

[start=4]
. The `install` target has compiled all the application sources but instead of creating an executable (`neorv32_exe.bit`) that can be uploaded via the
bootloader, it has created a VHDL memory initialization image `core/neorv32_application_image.vhd`.
. This VHDL file is automatically copied to the core's rtl folder (`rtl/core`) so it will be included for the next synthesis.
. Perform a new synthesis. The IMEM will be build as pre-initialized ROM (inferring embedded memories if possible).
. Upload your bitstream. Your application code now resides unchangeable in the processor's IMEM and is directly executed after reset.


The synthesis tool / simulator will print asserts to inform about the (IMEM) memory / boot configuration:

[source]
----
NEORV32 PROCESSOR CONFIG NOTE: Boot configuration: Direct boot from memory (processor-internal IMEM).
NEORV32 PROCESSOR CONFIG NOTE: Implementing processor-internal IMEM as ROM (3176 bytes), pre-initialized with application.

<<<
// ####################################################################################################################
:sectnums:
== Setup of a New Application Program Project

[start=1]
. The easiest way of creating a _new_ software application project is to copy an _existing_ one. This will keep all
file dependencies. For example you can copy `sw/example/blink_led` to `sw/example/flux_capacitor`.
. If you want to place you application somewhere outside `sw/example` you need to adapt the application's makefile.
In the makefile you will find a variable that keeps the relative or absolute path to the NEORV32 repo home
folder. Just modify this variable according to your new project's home location:

[source,makefile]
----
# Relative or absolute path to the NEORV32 home folder (use default if not set by user)
NEORV32_HOME ?= ../../..
----

[start=3]
. If your project contains additional source files outside of the project folder, you can add them to
the `APP_SRC` variable:

[source,makefile]
----
# User's application sources (add additional files here)
APP_SRC = $(wildcard *.c) ../somewhere/some_file.c
----

[start=4]
. You also can add a folder containing your application's include files to the
`APP_INC` variable (do not forget the `-I` prefix):

[source,makefile]
----
# User's application include folders (don't forget the '-I' before each entry)
APP_INC = -I . -I ../somewhere/include_stuff_folder
----



<<<
// ####################################################################################################################
:sectnums:
== Enabling RISC-V CPU Extensions

Whenever you enable/disable a RISC-V CPU extensions via the according `CPU_EXTENSION_RISCV_x` generic, you need to
adapt the toolchain configuration so the compiler can actually generate according code for it.

To do so, open the makefile of your project (for example `sw/example/blink_led/makefile`) and scroll to the
"USER CONFIGURATION" section right at the beginning of the file. You need to modify the `MARCH` variable and eventually
the `MABI` variable according to your CPU hardware configuration.

[source,makefile]
----
# CPU architecture and ABI
MARCH = -march=rv32i # <1>
MABI = -mabi=ilp32 # <2>
----
<1> MARCH = Machine architecture ("ISA string")
<2> MABI = Machine binary interface

For example, if you enable the RISC-V `C` extension (16-bit compressed instructions) via the `CPU_EXTENSION_RISCV_C`
generic (set `true`) you need to add the `c` extension also to the `MARCH` ISA string in order to make the compiler
emit compressed instructions.

.Privileged Architecture Extensions
[IMPORTANT]
Privileged architecture extensions like `Zicsr` or `Zifencei` are "used" _implicitly_ by the compiler. Hence, according
instruction will only be generated when "encoded" via inline assembly or when linking according libraries. In this case,
these instruction will _always_ be emitted (even if the according extension is not specified in `MARCH`). +
**I recommend to _not_ specify any privileged architecture extensions in `MARCH`.**

[WARNING]
ISA extension enabled in hardware can be a superset of the extensions enabled in software, but not the other way
around. For example generating compressed instructions for a CPU configuration that has the `c` extension disabled
will cause _illegal instruction exceptions_ at runtime.

You can also override the default `MARCH` and `MABI` configurations from the makefile when invoking the makefile:

[source,bash]
----
$ make MARCH=-march=rv32ic clean_all all
----

[NOTE]
The RISC-V ISA string for `MARCH` follows a certain _canonical_ structure:
`rev32[i/e][m][a][f][d][g][q][c][b][v][n]...` For example `rv32imac` is valid while `rv32icma` is not.

// ####################################################################################################################
:sectnums:
== Customizing the Internal Bootloader

The NEORV32 bootloader provides several options to configure and customize it for a certain application setup.
This configuration is done by passing _defines_ when compiling the bootloader. Of course you can also
modify to bootloader source code to provide a setup that perfectly fits your needs.

[IMPORTANT]
Each time the bootloader sources are modified, the bootloader has to be re-compiled (and re-installed to the
bootloader ROM) and the processor has to be re-synthesized.

[NOTE]
Keep in mind that the maximum size for the bootloader is limited to 32kB and should be compiled using the
base ISA `rv32i` only to ensure it can work independently of the actual CPU configuration.

.Bootloader configuration parameters
[cols="<2,^1,^2,<6"]
[options="header", grid="rows"]
|=======================
| Parameter | Default | Legal values | Description
4+^| Serial console interface
| `UART_EN`   | `1` | `0`, `1` | Set to `0` to disable UART0 (no serial console at all)
| `UART_BAUD` | `19200` | _any_ | Baud rate of UART0
4+^| Status LED
| `STATUS_LED_EN`  | `1` | `0`, `1` | Enable bootloader status led ("heart beat") at `GPIO` output port pin #`STATUS_LED_PIN` when `1`
| `STATUS_LED_PIN` | `0` | `0` ... `31` | `GPIO` output pin used for the high-active status LED
4+^| Boot configuration
| `AUTO_BOOT_SPI_EN`  | `0` | `0`, `1` | Set `1` to enable immediate boot from external SPI flash
| `AUTO_BOOT_OCD_EN`  | `0` | `0`, `1` | Set `1` to enable boot via on-chip debugger (OCD)
| `AUTO_BOOT_TIMEOUT` | `8` | _any_ | Time in seconds after the auto-boot sequence starts (if there is no UART input by user); set to 0 to disabled auto-boot sequence
4+^| SPI configuration
| `SPI_FLASH_CS`          | `0` | `0` ... `7` | SPI chip select output (`spi_csn_o`) for selecting flash
| `SPI_FLASH_SECTOR_SIZE` | `65536` | _any_ | SPI flash sector size in bytes
| `SPI_FLASH_CLK_PRSC`    | `CLK_PRSC_8`  | `CLK_PRSC_2` `CLK_PRSC_4` `CLK_PRSC_8` `CLK_PRSC_64` `CLK_PRSC_128` `CLK_PRSC_1024` `CLK_PRSC_2024` `CLK_PRSC_4096` | SPI clock pre-scaler (dividing main processor clock)
| `SPI_BOOT_BASE_ADDR`    | `0x08000000` | _any_ 32-bit value | Defines the _base_ address of the executable in external flash
|=======================

Each configuration parameter is implemented as C-language `define` that can be manually overridden (_redefined_) when
invoking the bootloader's makefile. The according parameter and its new value has to be _appended_
(using `+=`) to the makefile's `USER_FLAGS` variable. Make sure to use the `-D` prefix here.

For example, to configure a UART Baud rate of 57600 and redirecting the status LED to output pin 20
use the following command (_in_ the bootloader's source folder `sw/bootloader`):

.Example: customizing, re-compiling and re-installing the bootloader
[source,console]
----
$ make USER_FLAGS+=-DUART_BAUD=57600 USER_FLAGS+=-DSTATUS_LED_PIN=20 clean_all bootloader
----

[NOTE]
The `clean_all` target ensure that all libraries are re-compiled. The `bootloader` target will automatically
compile and install the bootloader to the HDL boot ROM (updating `rtl/core/neorv32_bootloader_image.vhd`).

:sectnums:
=== Bootloader Boot Configuration

The bootloader provides several _boot configurations_ that define where the actual application's executable
shall be fetched from. Note that the non-default boot configurations provide a smaller memory footprint
reducing boot ROM implementation costs.

:sectnums!:
==== Default Boot Configuration

The _default_ bootloader configuration provides a UART-based user interface that allows to upload new executables
at any time. Optionally, the executable can also be programmed to an external SPI flash by the bootloader (see
section <<_programming_an_external_spi_flash_via_the_bootloader>>).

This configuration also provides an _automatic boot sequence_ (auto-boot) which will start fetching an executable
from external SPI flash using the default SPI configuration. By this, the default bootloader configuration
provides a "non volatile program storage" mechanism that automatically boot from external SPI flash
(after `AUTO_BOOT_TIMEOUT`) while still providing the option to re-program SPI flash at any time
via the UART interface.

:sectnums!:
==== `AUTO_BOOT_SPI_EN`

The automatic boot from SPI flash (enabled when `AUTO_BOOT_SPI_EN` is `1`) will fetch an executable from an external
SPI flash (using the according _SPI configuration_) right after reset. The bootloader will start fetching
the image at SPI flash base address `SPI_BOOT_BASE_ADDR`.

Note that there is _no_ UART console to interact with the bootloader. However, this boot configuration will
output minimal status messages via UART (if `UART_EN` is `1`).

:sectnums!:
==== `AUTO_BOOT_OCD_EN`

If `AUTO_BOOT_OCD_EN` is `1` the bootloader is implemented as minimal "halt loop" to be used with the on-chip debugger.
After initializing the hardware, the CPU waits in this endless loop until the on-chip debugger takes control over
the core (to upload and run the actual executable). See section <<_debugging_using_the_on_chip_debugger>>
for more information on how to use the on-chip debugger to upload and run executables.

[NOTE]
All bootloader boot configuration support uploading new executables via the on-chip debugger.

[WARNING]
Note that this boot configuration does not load any executable at all! Hence,
this boot configuration is intended to be used with the on-chip debugger only.

== Programming an External SPI Flash via the Bootloader

The default processor-internal NEORV32 bootloader supports automatic booting from an external SPI flash.
This guide shows how to write an executable to the SPI flash via the bootloader so it can be automatically
fetched and executed after processor reset. For example, you can use a section of the FPGA bitstream configuration
memory to store an application executable.

[NOTE]
This section assumes the _default_ configuration of the NEORV32 bootloader.
See section <<_customizing_the_internal_bootloader>> on how to customize the bootloader and its setting
(for example the SPI chip-select port, the SPI clock speed or the flash base address for storing the executable).


:sectnums:
=== SPI Flash

The bootloader can access an SPI compatible flash via the processor top entity's SPI port. By default, the flash
chip-select line is to `spi_csn_o(0)` and uses 1/8 of the processor's main clock as clock frequency.
The SPI flash has to support single-byte read and write, 24-bit addresses and at least the following standard commands:

* READ `0x03`
* READ STATUS `0x05`
* WRITE ENABLE `0x06`
* PAGE PROGRAM `0x02`
* SECTOR ERASE `0xD8`
* READ ID `0x9E`

Compatible (FGPA configuration) SPI flash memories are for example the "Winbond W25Q64FV2 or the "Micron N25Q032A".


:sectnums:
=== Programming an Executable

[start=1]
. At first, reset the NEORV32 processor and wait until the bootloader start screen appears in your terminal program.
. Abort the auto boot sequence and start the user console by pressing any key.
. Press u to upload the executable that you want to store to the external flash:

[source]
----
CMD:> u
Awaiting neorv32_exe.bin...
----

[start=4]
. Send the binary in raw binary via your terminal program. When the upload is completed and "OK"
appears, press `p` to trigger the programming of the flash (do not execute the image via the `e`
command as this might corrupt the image):

[source]
----
CMD:> u
Awaiting neorv32_exe.bin... OK
CMD:> p
Write 0x000013FC bytes to SPI flash @ 0x00800000? (y/n)
----

[start=5]
. The bootloader shows the size of the executable and the base address inside the SPI flash where the
executable is going to be stored. A prompt appears: Type `y` to start the programming or type `n` to
abort.

[TIP]
Section <<_customizing_the_internal_bootloader>> show the according C-language `define` that can be modified
to specify the base address of the executable inside the SPI flash.

[source]
----
CMD:> u
Awaiting neorv32_exe.bin... OK
CMD:> p
Write 0x000013FC bytes to SPI flash @ 0x08000000? (y/n) y
Flashing... OK
CMD:>
----

[start=6]
. If "OK" appears in the terminal line, the programming process was successful. Now you can use the
auto boot sequence to automatically boot your application from the flash at system start-up without
any user interaction.

== Simulating the Processor

.WORK IN PROGRESS
[WARNING]
This Section Is Under Construction! +
 +
FIXME!

:sectnums:
=== Testbench

The NEORV32 project features a simple default testbench (`sim/neorv32_tb.simple.vhd`) that can be used to simulate
and test the processor setup. This testbench features a 100MHz clock and enables all optional peripheral and
CPU extensions except for the `E` extension and the TRNG IO module (that CANNOT be simulated due to its
combinatorial (looped) oscillator architecture).

The simulation setup is configured via the "User Configuration" section located right at the beginning of
the testbench's architecture. Each configuration constant provides comments to explain the functionality.

Besides the actual NEORV32 Processor, the testbench also simulates "external" components that are connected
to the processor's external bus/memory interface. These components are:

* an external instruction memory (that also allows booting from it)
* an external data memory
* an external memory to simulate "external IO devices"
* a memory-mapped registers to trigger the processor's interrupt signals

The following table shows the base addresses of these four components and their default configuration and
properties (attributes: `r` = read, `w` = write, `e` = execute, `a` = atomic accesses possible, `8` = byte-accessible, `16` =
half-word-accessible, `32` = word-accessible).

.Testbench: processor-external memories
[cols="^4,>3,^5,<11"]
[options="header",grid="rows"]
|=======================
| Base address | Size          | Attributes           | Description
| `0x00000000` | `imem_size_c` | `r/w/e,  a, 8/16/32` | external IMEM (initialized with application image)
| `0x80000000` | `dmem_size_c` | `r/w/e,  a, 8/16/32` | external DMEM
| `0xf0000000` |      64 bytes | `r/w/e, !a, 8/16/32` | external "IO" memory, atomic accesses will fail
| `0xff000000` |       4 bytes | `-/w/-,  a,  -/-/32` | memory-mapped register to trigger "machine external", "machine software" and "SoC Fast Interrupt" interrupts
|=======================

The simulated NEORV32 does not use the bootloader and directly boots the current application image (from
the `rtl/core/neorv32_application_image.vhd` image file). Make sure to use the `all` target of the
makefile to install your application as VHDL image after compilation:

[source, bash]
----
sw/example/blink_led$ make clean_all all
----

.Simulation-Optimized CPU/Processors Modules
[NOTE]
The `sim/rtl_modules` folder provides simulation-optimized versions of certain CPU/processor modules.
These alternatives can be used to replace the default CPU/processor HDL files to allow faster/easier/more
efficient simulation. **These files are not intended for synthesis!**

**Simulation Console Output**

Data written to the NEORV32 UART0 / UART1 transmitter is send to a virtual UART receiver implemented
as part of the testbench. Received chars are send to the simulator console and are also stored to a log file
(`neorv32.testbench_uart0.out` for UART0, `neorv32.testbench_uart1.out` for UART1) inside the simulator home folder.


:sectnums:
=== Faster Simulation Console Output

When printing data via the UART the communication speed will always be based on the configured BAUD
rate. For a simulation this might take some time. To have faster output you can enable the **simulation mode**
or UART0/UART1 (see section https://stnolting.github.io/neorv32/#_primary_universal_asynchronous_receiver_and_transmitter_uart0[Documentation: Primary Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter (UART0)]).

ASCII data send to UART0 will be immediately printed to the simulator console. Additionally, the
ASCII data is logged in a file (`neorv32.uart0.sim_mode.text.out`) in the simulator home folder. All
written 32-bit data is also dumped as 8-char hexadecimal value into a file
(`neorv32.uart0.sim_mode.data.out`) also in the simulator home folder.

ASCII data send to UART1 will be immediately printed to the simulator console. Additionally, the
ASCII data is logged in a file (`neorv32.uart1.sim_mode.text.out`) in the simulator home folder. All
written 32-bit data is also dumped as 8-char hexadecimal value into a file
(`neorv32.uart1.sim_mode.data.out`) also in the simulator home folder.

You can "automatically" enable the simulation mode of UART0/UART1 when compiling an application. In this case the
"real" UART0/UART1 transmitter unit is permanently disabled. To enable the simulation mode just compile
and install your application and add _UART0_SIM_MODE_ for UART0 and/or _UART1_SIM_MODE_ for UART1 to
the compiler's _USER_FLAGS_ variable (do not forget the `-D` suffix flag):

[source, bash]
----
sw/example/blink_led$ make USER_FLAGS+=-DUART0_SIM_MODE clean_all all
----

The provided define will change the default UART0/UART1 setup function in order to set the simulation mode flag in the according UART's control register.

[NOTE]
The UART simulation output (to file and to screen) outputs "complete lines" at once. A line is
completed with a line feed (newline, ASCII `\n` = 10).


:sectnums:
=== Simulation using GHDL

To simulate the processor using _GHDL_ navigate to the `sim` folder and run the provided shell script.
Any arguments that are provided while executing this script are passed to GHDL.
For example the simulation time can be set to 20ms using `--stop-time=20ms` as argument.

== Debugging using the On-Chip Debugger

The NEORV32 on-chip debugger allows _online_ in-system debugging via an external JTAG access port from a
host machine. The general flow is independent of the host machine's operating system. However, this tutorial uses
Windows and Linux (Ubuntu on Windows) in parallel.

[TIP]
See datasheet section https://stnolting.github.io/neorv32/#_on_chip_debugger_ocd[On Chip Debugger (OCD)]
for more information.

[NOTE]
This tutorial uses `gdb` to **directly upload an executable** to the processor. If you are using the default
processor setup _with_ internal instruction memory (IMEM) make sure it is implemented as RAM
(_INT_BOOTLOADER_EN_ generic = true).


:sectnums:
=== Hardware Requirements

Make sure the on-chip debugger of your NEORV32 setups is implemented (_ON_CHIP_DEBUGGER_EN_ generic = true).
Connect a JTAG adapter to the NEORV32 `jtag_*` interface signals. If you do not have a full-scale JTAG adapter, you can
also use a FTDI-based adapter like the "FT2232H-56Q Mini Module", which is a simple and inexpensive FTDI breakout board.

.JTAG pin mapping
[cols="^3,^2,^2"]
[options="header",grid="rows"]
|=======================
| NEORV32 top signal | JTAG signal | FTDI port
| `jtag_tck_i`       | TCK         | D0
| `jtag_tdi_i`       | TDI         | D1
| `jtag_tdo_o`       | TDO         | D2
| `jtag_tms_i`       | TMS         | D3
| `jtag_trst_i`      | TRST        | D4
|=======================

[TIP]
The low-active JTAG _test reset_ (TRST) signals is _optional_ as a reset can also be triggered via the TAP controller.
If TRST is not used make sure to pull the signal _high_.


:sectnums:
=== OpenOCD

The NEORV32 on-chip debugger can be accessed using the https://github.com/riscv/riscv-openocd[RISC-V port of OpenOCD].
Prebuilt binaries can be obtained - for example - from https://www.sifive.com/software[SiFive]. A pre-configured
OpenOCD configuration file (`sw/openocd/openocd_neorv32.cfg`) is available that allows easy access to the NEORV32 CPU.

[NOTE]
You might need to adapt `ftdi_vid_pid`, `ftdi_channel` and `ftdi_layout_init` in `sw/openocd/openocd_neorv32.cfg`
according to your interface chip and your operating system.

[TIP]
If you want to modify the JTAG clock speed (via `adapter speed` in `sw/openocd/openocd_neorv32.cfg`) make sure to meet
the clock requirements noted in https://stnolting.github.io/neorv32/#_debug_module_dm[Documentation: Debug Transport Module (DTM)].

To access the processor using OpenOCD, open a terminal and start OpenOCD with the pre-configured configuration file.

=== Debugging with GDB

This guide uses the simple "blink example" from `sw/example/blink_led` as simplified test application to
show the basics of in-system debugging.

At first, the application needs to be compiled. We will use the minimal machine architecture configuration
(`rv32i`) here to be independent of the actual processor/CPU configuration.
Navigate to `sw/example/blink_led` and compile the application:

.Compile the test application
[source, bash]
--------------------------
.../neorv32/sw/example/blink_led$ make MARCH=-march=rv32i clean_all all
--------------------------

This will generate an ELF file `main.elf` that contains all the symbols required for debugging.
Furthermore, an assembly listing file `main.asm` is generated that we will use to define breakpoints.

Open another terminal in `sw/example/blink_led` and start `gdb`.
The GNU debugger is part of the toolchain (see <<_software_toolchain_setup>>).

.Starting GDB (on Linux (Ubuntu on Windows))
[source, bash]

Type "apropos word" to search for commands related to "word".
(gdb)
--------------------------

Now connect to OpenOCD using the default port 3333 on your local machine.
Set the ELF file we want to debug to the recently generated `main.elf` from the `blink_led` example.
Finally, upload the program to the processor.

[NOTE]
The executable that is uploaded to the processor is **not** the default NEORV32 executable (`neorv32_exe.bin`) that
is used for uploading via the bootloader. Instead, all the required sections (like `.text`) are extracted from `mail.elf`
by GDB and uploaded via the debugger's indirect memory access.

.Running GDB
[source, bash]
--------------------------
(gdb) target remote localhost:3333 <1>
Remote debugging using localhost:3333

(gdb)
--------------------------
<1> Connect to OpenOCD
<2> The CPU was still executing code from the bootloader ROM - but that does not matter here
<3> Select `mail.elf` from the `blink_led` example
<4> Upload the executable

After the upload, GDB will make the processor jump to the beginning of the uploaded executable
(by default, this is the beginning of the instruction memory at `0x00000000`) skipping the bootloader
and halting the CPU right before executing the `blink_led` application.


:sectnums:
==== Breakpoint Example

The following steps are just a small showcase that illustrate a simple debugging scheme.

While compiling `blink_led`, an assembly listing file `main.asm` was generated.
Open this file with a text editor to check out what the CPU is going to do when resumed.

The `blink_led` example implements a simple counter on the 8 lowest GPIO output ports. The program uses
"busy wait" to have a visible delay between increments. This waiting is done by calling the `neorv32_cpu_delay_ms`
function. We will add a _breakpoint_ right at the end of this wait function so we can step through the iterations
of the counter.

.Cut-out from `main.asm` generated from the `blink_led` example
[source, assembly]
--------------------------
00000688 <__neorv32_cpu_delay_ms_end>:
 688:	01c12083          	lw	ra,28(sp)
 68c:	02010113          	addi	sp,sp,32
 690:	00008067          	ret
--------------------------

The very last instruction of the `neorv32_cpu_delay_ms` function is `ret` (= return)
at hexadecimal `690` in this example. Add this address as _breakpoint_ to GDB.

[NOTE]
The address might be different if you use a different version of the software framework or
if different ISA options are configured.

.Adding a GDB breakpoint
[source, bash]
--------------------------
(gdb) b * 0x690
Breakpoint 1 at 0x690
--------------------------

Now execute `c` (= continue). The CPU will resume operation until it hits the break-point.
By this we can "step" from increment to increment.

.Iterating from breakpoint to breakpoint
[source, bash]
--------------------------
Breakpoint 1 at 0x690
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, 0x00000690 in neorv32_cpu_delay_ms ()
(gdb) c
Continuing.
