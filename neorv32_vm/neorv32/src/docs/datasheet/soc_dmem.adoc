[NOTE]
The default `neorv32_dmem.vhd` HDL source file provides a _generic_ memory design that infers embedded
memory for _larger_ memory configurations. You might need to replace/modify the source file in order to use
platform-specific features (like advanced memory resources) or to improve technology mapping and/or timing.

Implementation of the processor-internal data memory is enabled via the processor's _MEM_INT_DMEM_EN_
generic. The size in bytes is defined via the _MEM_INT_DMEM_SIZE_ generic. If the DMEM is implemented,
the memory is mapped into the data memory space and located right at the beginning of the data memory
space (default `dspace_base_c` = 0x80000000). The DMEM is always implemented as RAM.
