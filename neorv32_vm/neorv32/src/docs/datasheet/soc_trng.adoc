**Theory of Operation**

The NEORV32 true random number generator provides _physical true random numbers_ for your application.
Instead of using a pseudo RNG like a LFSR, the TRNG of the processor uses a simple, straight-forward ring
oscillator as physical entropy source. Hence, voltage and thermal fluctuations are used to provide true
physical random data.

[NOTE]
The TRNG features a platform independent architecture without FPGA-specific primitives, macros or
attributes.

**Architecture**

The NEORV32 TRNG is based on simple ring oscillators, which are implemented as an inverter chain with
an odd number of inverters. A **latch** is used to decouple each individual inverter. Basically, this architecture
is some king of asynchronous LFSR.

The output of several ring oscillators are synchronized using two registers and are XORed together. The
resulting output is de-biased using a von-Neumann randomness extractor. This de-biased output is further
processed by a simple 8-bit Fibonacci LFSR to improve whitening. After at least 8 clock cycles the state of
the LFSR is sampled and provided as final data output.

To prevent the synthesis tool from doing logic optimization and thus, removing all but one inverter, the
TRNG uses simple latches to decouple an inverter and its actual output. The latches are reset when the
TRNG is disabled and are enabled one by one by a "real" shift register when the TRNG is activated. This
construct can be synthesized for any FPGA platform. Thus, the NEORV32 TRNG provides a platform
independent architecture.

**TRNG Configuration**

The TRNG uses several ring-oscillators, where the next oscillator provides a slightly longer chain (more
inverters) than the one before. This increment is constant for all implemented oscillators. This setup can be
customized by modifying the "Advanced Configuration" constants in the TRNG's VHDL file:

* The `num_roscs_c` constant defines the total number of ring oscillators in the system. num_inv_start_c
defines the number of inverters used by the first ring oscillators (has to be an odd number). Each additional
ring oscillator provides `num_inv_inc_c` more inverters that the one before (has to be an even number).
* The LFSR-based post-processing can be deactivated using the `lfsr_en_c` constant. The polynomial tap
mask of the LFSR can be customized using `lfsr_taps_c`.

**Using the TRNG**

The TRNG features a single register for status and data access. When the _TRNG_CT_EN_ control register bit is
set, the TRNG is enabled and starts operation. As soon as the _TRNG_CT_VALID_ bit is set, the currently
sampled 8-bit random data byte can be obtained from the lowest 8 bits of the TRNG_CT register
(_TRNG_CT_DATA_MSB_ : _TRNG_CT_DATA_LSB_). The _TRNG_CT_VALID_ bit is automatically cleared
when reading the control register.

[IMPORTANT]
The TRNG needs at least 8 clock cycles to generate a new random byte. During this sampling time
the current output random data is kept stable in the output register until a valid sampling of the new byte has
completed.

Randomness "Quality"
I have not verified the quality of the generated random numbers (for example using NIST test suites). The
quality is highly effected by the actual configuration of the TRNG and the resulting FPGA mapping/routing.
However, generating larger histograms of the generated random number shows an equal distribution (binary
average of the random numbers = 127). A simple evaluation test/demo program can be found in
`sw/example/demo_trng`.
