**Theory of Operation**

SPI is a synchronous serial transmission interface. The NEORV32 SPI transceiver allows 8-, 16-, 24- and 32-
bit long transmissions. The unit provides 8 dedicated chip select signals via the top entity's `spi_csn_o`
signal.

The SPI unit is enabled via the _SPI_CT_EN_ bit in the _SPI_CT_ control register. The idle clock polarity is configured via the _SPI_CT_CPHA_
bit and can be low (`0`) or high (`1`) during idle. The data quantity to be transferred within a
single transmission is defined via the _SPI_CT_SIZEx bits_. The unit supports 8-bit (`00`), 16-bit (`01`), 24-
bit (`10`) and 32-bit (`11`) transfers. Whenever a transfer is completed, the "transmission done interrupt" is triggered.
A transmission is still in progress as long as the _SPI_CT_BUSY_ flag is set.

The SPI controller features 8 dedicated chip-select lines. These lines are controlled via the control register's _SPI_CT_CSx_ bits. When
a specifc _SPI_CT_CSx_ bit is **set**, the according chip select line `spi_csn_o(x)` goes **low** (low-active chip select lines).

The SPI clock frequency is defined via the 3-bit _SPI_CT_PRSCx_ clock prescaler. The following prescalers
are available:

| **`SPI_CT_PRSCx`**          | `0b000` | `0b001` | `0b010` | `0b011` | `0b100` | `0b101` | `0b110` | `0b111`
| Resulting `clock_prescaler` |       2 |       4 |       8 |      64 |     128 |    1024 |    2048 |    4096
|=======================

Based on the _SPI_CT_PRSCx_ configuration, the actual SPI clock frequency f~SPI~ is derived from the processor's main clock f~main~ and is determined by:

_**f~SPI~**_ = _f~main~[Hz]_ / (2 * `clock_prescaler`)

A transmission is started when writing data to the _SPI_DATA_ register. The data must be LSB-aligned. So if
the SPI transceiver is configured for less than 32-bit transfers data quantity, the transmit data must be placed
into the lowest 8/16/24 bit of _SPI_DATA_. Vice versa, the received data is also always LSB-aligned.
